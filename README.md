# Daily dose of FPGA

Welcome, visitor üëã.

‚ùó If you're here, you're potentially curious about FPGAs and low-level coding. I welcome you to this repo, where I will be sharing the small projects I tackle as I learn FPGA design from the ground up.

üëâ Maybe you're also a beginner wanting to learn about FPGAs, and these incremental projects will be useful for you!

> I'm using the [`pico-ice` board](https://pico-ice.tinyvision.ai/) which features an iCE40UP5K FPGA from Lattice Semi with 5.2 K LUTs.

Learning to speak **Verilog** has been a long-standing project of mine. The steep learning curve and the busy everyday have led me to keep postponing it.
Well, not anymore.

For the next weeks, I'll be in my village by the mountains of northern Spain, without distractions. I brought my FPGA development board, my digital design book and my laptop.

The goal? Becoming knowledgeable in FPGA design.

The rules are simple. Each day:
- I'll share the things I learnt on my [Bluesky account](https://bsky.app/profile/inigoliz.bsky.social).
- I'll build on the content learnt to put together a small self-contained project.

The capstone project is TBD, but it will be something fun around FPGA and neural networks.

üìà Tag along on this open-learning journey!
