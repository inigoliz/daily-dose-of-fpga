# Day 1

Day 1 has been about setting up the development environment, understanding the datasheet
of the `pico-ice` board and creating a simple sketch that toggles between the red and
blue LEDs on each press.

- Seeting up development environment: I'll use [`apio`](https://fpgawars.github.io/apio/) SDK (coding + synthesis + place and route + deployment).
- Understanding the `pico-ice` [datasheet](https://pico-ice.tinyvision.ai/md_pinout.html) and locating
the pins of the push button and color LEDs.
- Learning to define wires, registers and clock-triggered assignments.

Final project:

Red-blue toggle
